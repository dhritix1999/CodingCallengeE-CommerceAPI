# CodingCallengeE-CommerceAPI
This is my solution for Maha's backend coding challenge, where I built a simple e-commerce API endpoint using Spring Boot.

# How to Run
Before running the application, you will need to make sure you are have Maven and Java 11

You can build the project and run the tests by using the following command:

``` mvn clean install ```

Run the application using:

``` mvn -pl web spring-boot:run ```

This is the API endpoint to carry out the checkout request

``` http://localhost:8080/checkout/ ```
